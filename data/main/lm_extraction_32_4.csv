When it comes to street food Asia is without a doubt the leader in terms of top notch delectable and inexpensive bite sized delights. Prior to teaching English in South Korea, having grown up in Canada, I really didn't know what street food was all about. Over the past decade, having focused most of my time living and traveling in Asia, I've become such a huge fan of street food that I feel as though I'm being robbed whenever I visit a country or city where I'm unable to get it.
