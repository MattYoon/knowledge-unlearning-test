stating that a decision should be entered awarding compensation. The undersigned

  Because this unpublished decision contains a reasoned explanation for the action in this case, the
undersigned intends to post it on the United States Court of Federal Claims' website, in accordance with
the E-Government Act of 2002. 44 U.S.C. § 3501 note (2012) (Federal Management and Promotion of
Electronic Government Services). In accordance with Vaccine Rule 18(b), petitioner has 14 days to
identify and move to redact medical or other information, the disclosure of which would constitute an
unwarranted invasion of privacy. If, upon review, the undersigned agrees that the identified material fits
within this definition, the undersigned will redact"

        agreement by the parties; b) by declaration of the Mediator to the effect that further efforts at mediation
        are no longer worthwhile; or c) after the completion of one full mediation session, by a written declaration
        of a party or parties to the effect that the mediation proceedings are terminated.

xvi.    Exclusion of Liability. The Mediator is not a necessary or proper party in judicial proceedings relating to
        the mediation. Neither Mediator nor any law firm employing Mediator shall be liable to any party for any
        act or omission in connection with any mediation conducted under these rules.

Additional         information         is     available     at      the         court’s

      pleadings, the appellate court should order a judgment
      entered for the defendant on the ground that the facts
      elicited at trial demonstrated a good defense to the action
      rather than because of the defect in the pleadings.28
   [8] Neb. Ct. R. Pldg. § 6-1115(b) is substantially identical to
Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b).29 Our rule explicitly provides that
      amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause
      them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues
      may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even
      after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the

a   certificate        of    appealability.           28   U.S.C.    § 2253(c)(1)(A)

             (1) Effect.    An appellant=s failure to timely file a brief does not

HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY GRANTED BY THE TRIAL COURT OR THIS COURT, it
is temporarily continued for a period not to exceed sixty days upon the bail previously
posted. The purpose of a continued stay is to allow Appellant to file with the Supreme
Court of Ohio an application for a stay during the pendency of proceedings in that court.
If a stay is continued by this entry, it will terminate at the earlier of the expiration of the
sixty day period, or the failure of the Appellant to file a notice of appeal with the
Supreme Court of Ohio in the forty-five day appeal period pursuant to Rule II, Sec. 2 of
the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Additionally, if the Supreme Court
of Ohio dismisses the appeal prior to expiration of sixty days"
