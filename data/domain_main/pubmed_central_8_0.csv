  Geometry. Bond distances, angles etc. have been calculated using the rounded fractional coordinates. All su\'s are estimated from the variances of the (full) variance-covariance matrix. The cell esds are taken into account in the estimation of distances, angles and torsion angles
  Refinement. Refinement on F^2^ for ALL reflections except those flagged by the user for potential systematic errors. Weighted R-factors wR and all goodnesses of fit S are based on F^2^, conventional R-factors R are based on F, with F set to zero for negative F^2^. The observed criterion of F^2^ \> 2sigma(F^2^) is used only for calculating -R-factor-obs etc. and is not relevant to the choice of"
