Because so much winning, another good ole bigot - with an actual bully pulpit - has crawled out of his cave to call for the Ku Klux Klan ""to night ride again"" and hang Democrats, ""Republican Democrats"" and ""socialist-communists"" with ""hemp ropes to clean out D.C."" The newspaper of one Goodloe Sutton has evidently long been ""a cesspool of indefensible bilge."" Hence, when asked about the propriety of his call, this defense of the Klan: ""Well, they didn't kill but a few people."" Thanks Trump.

Booking as a group?

Many sites set a maximum occupancy of 6/8 people per pitch, so try breaking your booking down into smaller groups to generate more results. For example, if you’re a group of 10, enter 5 people in your initial search and then book 2 pitches.

However, where the pitch or accommodation occupancy allows it, you can now make a booking for up to 30 adults and 30 children on one pitch.

To book multiple pitches or accommodation, use the 'Special requests' box on the booking page to ask to be sited together. Complete the booking form for the first booking (you can add a password and save your card so that we remember your details). Then click ""Make another booking like this"" at the top of the confirmation page to make the next booking."
