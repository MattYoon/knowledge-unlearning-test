      In any of the following cases the United States court in
      and for the district wherein the award was made may
      make an order vacating the award upon the application of
      any party to the arbitration—
          (1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud,
      or undue means;
          (2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in
      the arbitrators, or either of them;
          (3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in
      refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause
"
10632,freelaw,"       The Court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.

      It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this Court directing the Highland
County Court of Common Pleas to carry this judgment into execution.

        IF A STAY OF EXECUTION OF SENTENCE AND RELEASE UPON BAIL HAS
BEEN PREVIOUSLY GRANTED BY THE TRIAL COURT OR THIS COURT, it is
temporarily continued for a period not to exceed sixty days upon the bail previously
posted. The purpose of a continued stay is to allow Appellant to file with the Supreme
Court of Ohio an application for a stay during the pendency of proceedings in that court.
If a stay is continued by this entry, it will terminate at the earlier of the expiration of the
sixty day period, or the failure of the Appellant to file a notice of appeal with"

    is considered separately, not cumulatively, for purposes of determining
    whether it is cruel and unusual.
11. Sentences: Appeal and Error. Where a sentence imposed within the
    statutory limits is alleged on appeal to be excessive, the appellate court
    must determine whether a sentencing court abused its discretion in con-
    sidering and applying the relevant factors as well as any applicable legal
    principles in determining the sentence to be imposed.
12. Sentences. In determining a sentence to be imposed, relevant factors
    customarily considered and applied are the defendant’s (1) age, (2) men-
    tality, (3) education and experience, (4) social and cultural background,
    (5) past criminal record or record of law-abiding conduct, and (6) moti-

      I.      Legal Standard

         The Vaccine Act permits an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. §
15(e). Counsel must submit fee requests that include contemporaneous and specific
billing records indicating the service performed, the number of hours expended on the
service, and the name of the person performing the service. See Savin v. Sec’y of
Health & Human Servs., 85 Fed. Cl. 313, 316-18 (2008). Counsel should not include in
their fee requests hours that are “excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.”

                        ANDREWS and RICKMAN, JJ.

                   NOTICE: Motions for reconsideration must be
                   physically received in our clerk’s office within ten
                   days of the date of decision to be deemed timely filed.

11366,freelaw,"  ____. Neb. Rev. Stat. § 28-319(1)(b) (Reissue 2016) applies to a wide
      array of situations that affect a victim’s capacity, including age.
10.   Jury Instructions: Evidence: Appeal and Error. When examining for
      harmless error, the court may look at a variety of factors including the
      jury instructions as a whole, the evidence presented at trial, and the clos-
      ing arguments.
11.   Convictions: Evidence: Appeal and Error. In reviewing a criminal
      conviction for a sufficiency of the evidence claim, whether the evidence
      is direct, circumstantial, or a combination thereof, the standard is the
      same: An appellate court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence, pass
   "

       Sentencing is a matter for the trial court’s discretion. Both our standard of review and the
factors to be considered in evaluating the reasonableness of the sentence are well established and
need not be repeated here. See State v. Hernandez, 121 Idaho 114, 117-18, 822 P.2d 1011, 1014-
